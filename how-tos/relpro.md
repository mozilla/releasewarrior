# Pre-requirements 
## taskcluster related
* **You need 2 bookmarklets in your browser to enhance the work with taskcluster**
  * Create a new bookmark, name it `Stop`, add `javascript:stop();` to Location
  * click and drag the [sort table](https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/pagedata.html#sort_table) link to your Bookmarks Toolbar. [Rail](https://github.com/rail) found a fancier sort table [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rail/11314a9e04cdabb33ccabc5419ef90d0/raw/21e095893a743df2a4a735cbcc751e165f2f6d98/table%2520sorter)
* Find the email with subject: "[desktop] Build of Firefox-46.0b4-build2" - it contains a link to the task graph
* After the task graph is loaded click on the "stop" bookmarklet
* Click the "sort table" bookmarklet - you'll get "a/d" table headers
* Sort the table by "State" ascending, so you get unscheduled and  scheduled tasks first

## tctalker setup
* **You need tctalker to play nicely with taskcluster jobs**
* navigate to [Taskcluster tools](https://tools.taskcluster.net) and make sure you're logged-in
* make sure the following scopes are listed under your [Taskcluster credentials](https://tools.taskcluster.net/credentials/):
```
auth:create-client:mozilla-ldap/<ldap_username>/*
auth:create-client:project/releng/*
```
* navigate to [Taskcluster clients](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/clients/) and create a new clientId - dedicated for playing with tctalker. 
* it should already be pre-formatted to `mozilla-ldap/<ldap_username>/` at which you can concatenate any string. You can simply add *tctalker*.
* use *queue:** for **Client Scopes**
* hit the **Create Client** button and make sure you save the *Access token* that is generated
* create a json config file (e.g. "config.json") on disk that looks like this:

```
{
    "credentials": {
        "clientId": "you-will-never-guess",
        "accessToken": "nor here!"
    }
}
```

* clone yourself a copy of [tctalker](https://github.com/mozilla/tctalker) and change directory to the clone repo
* run the following:
```
python src/tctalker/tctalker.py --conf config.json <action> <task-id> 
```
# Actions

## 1. email drivers re: release live on cdntest channel

### why
* cdntest channels serve releases from the releases dir (mirrors) or candidates dir depending on the release. They are testing channels that are a final step before we serve from the _real_ update channel
* we should notify drivers once updates are available on the ${branch}-cdntest channel because we don't have taskcluster email notifications yet

### when
* there are currently two types of releases that automatically push to releases dir:

* Desktop Firefox Betas
    * look in taskgraph for task with name `mozilla-beta beta final verification`
        * once this task has run successfully, that means we have 1) pushed to releases dir 2) and verified beta-cdntest is serving the release from there

* Desktop Firefox Release-Candidates (RCs get served on beta and release channel)
    * `beta-cdntest` serves updates from the candidates dir of RCs but `release-cdntest` is still human decision and so `release-cdntest` emails are not required
        * look in taskgraph graph 1 for task with name `mozilla-beta beta final verification`
        * once this task has run successfully, that means the release has finished uploading all artifacts to candidates dir 2) and verified beta-cdntest is serving the release from there
    
### how
* Desktop Firefox Betas
    * email release-drivers@mozilla.com with subject only email `[desktop] Firefox Beta $version updates are available on the beta-cdntest channel now <EOM>`
* Desktop Firefox Release-Candidates (RCs get served on beta and release channel)
    * email release-drivers@mozilla.com with subject only email `[desktop] Firefox RC Release $version updates are available on the beta-cdntest channel now <EOM>`


## 2. push to releases dir (mirrors)

### why
* some releases don't automatically push releases to the releases dir automatically. They instead wait on a human decision (sign off) to dictate when candidates dir looks good and we are ready to copy/push to releases dir

### when
* Desktop Firefox Release-Candidate Releases
    * release-cdntest channel serves updates from releases dir so it depends on this step unlike RC beta-cdntest channel
    * wait for sign off from release-drivers with email like: `[desktop] Please push ${version} to ${channel}` where version is like `46.0 build 3` and channel is like `release-cdntest` or `cdntest` or `mirrors` or `releases`
        * note: if they do not explicitly ask for `release-cdntest` it is okay to assume if you are confident but please reply with something like `pushed and please use explicit name when requesting next time: release-cdntest channel :)`
* Desktop Firefox Releases (dot releases)
    * wait for sign off from release-drivers with email like: `[desktop] Please push ${version} to {cdntest,releases,mirrors}` where version is like: `46.0.1 build 5`, and channel is like: `release-cdntest` or `cdntest` or `mirrors` or `releases`
        * note: if they do not explicitly ask for `release-cdntest` it is okay to assume if you are confident but please reply with something like `pushed and please use explicit name when requesting next time: release-cdntest channel :)`
* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * wait for sign off from release-drivers with email like: `[desktop] Please push ${version} to {cdntest,releases,mirrors}` where version is like: `38.0esr` or `38.2.0esr`, and channel is like: `esr-cdntest` or `cdntest` or `mirrors` or `releases`
        * note: if they do not explicitly ask for `release-cdntest` it is okay to assume if you are confident but please reply with something like `pushed and please use explicit name when requesting next time: esr-cdntest channel :)`

### how
* Desktop Firefox Release-Candidate Releases
    * RC releases depend on two taskcluster graphs. pushing to releases happens in graph 2 and will start once graph 2 is submitted.
    * to generate and submit graph 2 of the release:
        * step 1) get a taskid from a any task in graph 1. this is used by graph 2 for obtaining release version, branch, etc.
        * step 2) call releasetasks_graph_gen.py and pass, among other things, the taskid obtained in step 1:
```bash 
$ ssh `whoami`@buildbot-master85.bb.releng.scl3.mozilla.com  # host we release-runner and you generate/submit new release promotion graphs
$ sudo su - cltbld
$ TASK_TASKID_FROM_GRAPH1={insert a taskid from any task in graph 1}
$ cd /home/cltbld/releasetasks/
$ git pull origin master  # make sure we are up to date. note: make sure this is on master and clean first
$ cd /builds/releaserunner/tools/buildfarm/release/
$ hg pull -u # make sure we are up to date. note: make sure this is on default and clean first
$ source /builds/releaserunner/bin/activate 
# call releasetasks_graph_gen.py with --dry-run and sanity check the graph output that would be submitted
$ python releasetasks_graph_gen.py --release-runner-ini=../../../release-runner.ini --branch-and-product-config=/home/cltbld/releasetasks/releasetasks/release_configs/prod_mozilla-release_firefox_rc_graph_2.yml --common-task-id=$TASK_TASKID_FROM_GRAPH1 --dry-run
# call releasetasks_graph_gen.py for reals which will submit the graph to Taskcluster
$ python releasetasks_graph_gen.py --release-runner-ini=../../../release-runner.ini --branch-and-product-config=/home/cltbld/releasetasks/releasetasks/release_configs/prod_mozilla-release_firefox_rc_graph_2.yml --common-task-id=$TASK_TASKID_FROM_GRAPH1
```

* Desktop Firefox Releases (dot releases)
    * wait for sign off from release-drivers with email like: `[desktop] Please push ${version} to {cdntest,releases,mirrors}` where version is like: `46.0.1 build 5`, and channel is like: `release-cdntest` or `cdntest` or `mirrors` or `releases`
        * note: if they do not explicitly ask for `release-cdntest` it is okay to assume if you are confident but please reply with something like `pushed and please use explicit name when requesting next time: release-cdntest channel :)`
    * get taskid from task with name `firefox mozilla-release push to releases human decision task` in task graph
    * This task is blocking `[beetmover] firefox mozilla-release push to releases`
    * To resolve the human decision task run the following:
```bash
 tctalker --conf ~/.taskcluster/relpro.json report_completed $TASK_ID
```

* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * wait for sign off from release-drivers with email like: `[desktop] Please push ${version} to {cdntest,releases,mirrors}` where version is like: `38.0esr` or `38.2.0esr`, and channel is like: `esr-cdntest` or `cdntest` or `mirrors` or `releases`
        * note: if they do not explicitly ask for `esr-cdntest` it is okay to assume if you are confident but please reply with something like `pushed and please use explicit name when requesting next time: esr-cdntest channel :)`
* ESR releases depend on two taskcluster graphs. pushing to releases happens in graph 2 and will start once graph 2 is submitted.
    * to generate and submit graph 2 of the release:
        * step 1) get a taskid from a any task in graph 1. this is used by graph 2 for obtaining release version, branch, etc.
        * step 2) call releasetasks_graph_gen.py and pass, among other things, the taskid obtained in step 1:
```bash
$ ssh `whoami`@buildbot-master85.bb.releng.scl3.mozilla.com  # host we release-runner and you generate/submit new release promotion graphs

$ cd /home/cltbld/releasetasks/
$ git pull origin master  # make sure we are up to date. note: make sure this is on master and clean first
$ cd /builds/releaserunner/tools/buildfarm/release/

```


## 3. publish release

### why
* the publish release human decision task makes the release go _live_. it
  requires sign off from rel-man / QE. It triggers the publish to balrog task
  for all graph types, plus the update bouncer aliases and bump version tasks
  for betas and RC graph2 graphs.

### when
* Desktop Firefox Betas
    * Wait for email from RelMan or QE with subject request like `please push Firefox 47.0b2 to the beta channel`
    * sanity check all update verify and the final verify task has completed successfully in the graph
* Desktop Firefox Release-Candidate (beta release prior to release release)
    * Wait for email from RelMan or QE with subject request like `please push Firefox 46.0 to the beta channel`
    * sanity check all beta update verify and the beta final verify task has completed successfully in graph 1
* Desktop Firefox Release and Release-Candidate (RC and dot releases both push to release channel)
    * Wait for email from RelMan or QE with subject request like `please push Firefox 46.0 to the release channel`
    * sanity check all release update verify tasks from graph 1 and the release final verify task has completed successfully from graph 2
* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * Wait for email from RelMan or QE with subject request like `please push Firefox 45.2.0esr to the esr channel`
    * sanity check all release update verify tasks from graph 1 and the release final verify task has completed successfully from graph 2

### how
* Desktop Firefox Betas, Desktop Firefox Release-Candidate (beta release prior to release release) and Desktop Firefox dot Releases
    * go to the task graph (there is only one) and find taskId of `publish release human decision task`
    * Resolve the "publish release human decision" task using the command below
    * reply to RelMan's email as soon as this step is completed
* Desktop Firefox Release and Release-Candidate (RC releases push to release channel)
    * go to the task graph #2 and find taskId of `publish release human decision task`
    * Resolve the "publish release human decision" task using the command below
    * reply to RelMan's email as soon as this step is completed
* Desktop Firefox ESRs
    * depending on timing you may have 1 or 2 graphs. Go to the latest one and
      find taskId of `publish release human decision task`
    * Resolve the "publish release human decision" task using the command below
    * reply to RelMan's email as soon as this step is completed
```bash
 tctalker --conf ~/.taskcluster/relpro.json report_completed $TASK_ID
```

## 4. post release step

### why
* releases are needed to be marked as "shipped" in Ship-it to make the partial
  guessing algorithm work and make sure the product-details site has correct information
  about releases.

### when
* immediately after running `publish in Balrog` human decision step

### how
* Releases are needed to be marked as shipped on Ship It. To do so, visit
  https://ship-it.mozilla.org/releases.html, find the release in question, and
  click the "Shipped!" button.
