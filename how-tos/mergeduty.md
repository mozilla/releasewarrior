This document is the new version of https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Merge_Duty/Steps. It's heavily inspired by https://gist.github.com/lundjordan/b66bff783b6853e024f6.

# MergeDuty Tasks

**Consists of roughly 4 individual days of work. Each day you must action several sequential tasks. The 4 days are spread out over about 18 days**

## Terminology

* Merge Prep Day: day we prepare for the upcoming 'Release Merge Day' and 'Stabilizing Branch Merge Day'
  * when: day 1 - usually a monday and 1 week before 'Release Merge Day'
* Release Merge Day: day we merge csets from 'm-b -> m-r'
  * when: day 7 usually a mon and 1 week before 'Stabilizing Branch Merge Day'
* Stabilizing Branches Merge Day: day we merge csets from 'm-a -> m-b' and 'm-c -> m-a'
  * when: day 14 usually a mon and 1 day before 'Release Day'
* Release Day: official day of release
  * when: day 15 usually a Tues
* Unthrottle Day: day we unthrottle m-a (usually)
  * when: day 18 usually Fri

## Pre-requirements

1. Edit `~/.hgrc` to include:
```ini
[extensions]
transplant=
mq=
rebase=
graphlog=
```
1. Have your computer wired to a stable Internet connection (several gecko clones and huge pushes are planned).
1. File a merge day bug, if it's not done already. [Example](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1123369).

## Day 1 - Prep day #1

1. On the merge day bug, create 2 patches to bump [gecko_versions.json](https://dxr.mozilla.org/build-central/source/buildbot-configs/mozilla/gecko_versions.json). Get them reviewed but **don't land them yet**
  1. patch 1: bump **only mozilla-release**. It will serve Firefox's release candidate. [Example](https://bug1123369.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8580307).
  1. patch 2: bump the remaining branches. This includes m-b, m-a, m-c and comm branches. [Example](https://bug1123369.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8580308).

1. do a no-op trial run of performing the mozilla-beta -> mozilla-release migration:
```sh
mkdir merge_day
cd merge_day
wget https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/raw-file/default/buildfarm/utils/archiver_client.py
python archiver_client.py mozharness --destination mozharness-central --repo mozilla-central --rev default --debug  # Central must be used against every branch
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py -c merge_day/beta_to_release.py
 ```
1. The script should have created a diff:
```sh
hg -R build/mozilla-release diff
```

## Day 7 - Release Merge Day

### Reconfigs part 1

1. Look at the merge day bug and see if patches need to land at this stage.
1. Land "patch 1" to `default` branch, wait for tests to run and confirm they pass in #releng
1. Wait 1 hour for the reconfig to happen (via cron job). If you can't wait, ask for a manual reconfig to buildduty folks.
1. Wait for the go-to-merge email in release-drivers

### Merge beta to release

1. [Close mozilla-beta](https://mozilla-releng.net/treestatus/show/mozilla-beta). Check "Remember this change to undo later".
1. Run the [no-op trial run](#day-1-merge-prep-day) one more time, and show the diff to your co-releaseduty.
1. Push your changes:
```sh
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py \
  -c selfserve/production.py -c merge_day/beta_to_release.py \
  --create-virtualenv --commit-changes --push
```
:warning: If an issue comes up during this phase, you may not be able to ran this command (or the no-op one) correctly. You may need to publicly backout some tags/changesets to get back in a known state.
1. Verify changesets are visible on [hg pushlog](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/pushloghtml) and [Treeherder]( https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-release). It may take a couple of minutes to appear.

### Bump ESR version

Note: you may have 1 or 2 ESRs to bump.

1. Steps are similar to a merge:
```sh
# go to merge_day directory, created on day 1
ESR_VERSION=52
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py -c merge_day/bump_esr.py
hg -R build/mozilla-esr$ESR_VERSION diff
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py -c merge_day/bump_esr.py \
  --commit-changes --push
```
1. Verify new changesets popped on https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr`$ESR_VERSION`/pushloghtml

### Uplift locales

1. There are several tens of repos to upgrade. Using an external machine saves time.  You need access to ffxbld_rsa, so probably use a buildbot master; **Do not copy ffxbld_rsa around!**

```sh
ssh buildbot-master01.bb.releng.use1.mozilla.com
screen
sudo su - cltbld
mkdir l10n && cd l10n
wget https://hg.mozilla.org/build/braindump/raw-file/default/releases-related/beta2release_l10n.sh
chmod 755 beta2release_l10n.sh
export SSH_KEY=/home/cltbld/.ssh/ffxbld_rsa
./beta2release_l10n.sh 2>&1 | tee -a l10n.log  # Can be rerun. Cloned locales are skipped. If a locale failed pushing, delete the repo.
# after you're done, clean up
cd
rm -rf l10n
```

### It's done!

1. Reply to the migration request with the template:

```
This is now complete:
* mozilla-beta is merged to mozilla-release, new version is XX.Y
* l10n mozilla-beta repos are merged to mozilla-release
* esr is now XX.Y.Z
* beta will stay closed until next Monday
```

## Day 11 - Prep day #2
1. Similar to prep day #1 (you may need to redownload `mozharness-central`):
```sh
# go to merge_day directory, created on day 1
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py -c merge_day/central_to_beta.py
```

## Day 14 - Stabilizing Branches Merge Day

### Reconfigs part 2

1. Do the same things as part 1, except you should land "patch 2" instead.

### Merge central to beta

It's almost identical to beta to release:

1. Ping l10n folks in #releng (usually `Pike`) and send them a heads-up that we're about to perform the merge so that they can coordinate and sync timing of the l10n side of things
1. (be aware that for this step, LDAP credentials will be asked for the trigger-builders step)
```sh
# go to merge_day directory, created on day 1
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py -c merge_day/central_to_beta.py
hg -R build/mozilla-beta diff # Validate it with someone else
python mozharness-central/scripts/merge_day/gecko_migration.py \
  -c selfserve/production.py -c merge_day/central_to_beta.py \
  --create-virtualenv --commit-changes --push --trigger-builders
```
1. run l10n-bumper against beta
```
ssh buildbot-master01.bb.releng.use1.mozilla.com
sudo su - cltbld
cd /builds/l10n-bumper
python2.7 mozharness/scripts/l10n_bumper.py -c mozharness/configs/l10n_bumper/mozilla-beta.py --ignore-closed-tree
```
1. Verify changesets are visible on [hg pushlog](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/pushloghtml) and [Treeherder]( https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-beta). It may take a couple of minutes to appear.
1. Ping l10n folks in #releng (usually `Pike`) and send them a heads-up that RelEng side of migration is completed
1. Trigger nightlies for central. This can be done by:
    1. trigger [nightly-desktop/mozilla-central](https://tools.taskcluster.net/hooks/#project-releng/nightly-desktop%252fmozilla-central) hook
    1. trigger [nightly-fennec/mozilla-central](https://tools.taskcluster.net/hooks/#project-releng/nightly-fennec%252fmozilla-central) hook
    1. go to [BuildAPI](https://secure.pub.build.mozilla.org/buildapi/self-serve/mozilla-central) and look for `Create new nightly builds on mozilla-central revision`. Fill in the latest nightly revision and trigger the nightlies!
1. Tell sheriffs this migration is done either by popping a short message in #sheriffs or ping the `<handle>|sheriffduty` person from #releng.

### Update wikis

1.
```sh
wget https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/raw-file/default/buildfarm/maintenance/wiki_functions.sh
wget https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/raw-file/default/buildfarm/maintenance/update_merge_day_wiki.sh
export WIKI_USERNAME=asasaki
export WIKI_PASSWORD=*******
NEW_ESR_VERSION=52  # Only if a new ESR comes up (for instance 52.0esr)
./update_merge_day_wiki.sh # Or ./update_merge_day_wiki.sh -e $NEW_ESR_VERSION
```
1. Check the new values:
  * [NEXT_VERSION](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/release/next)
  * [CENTRAL_VERSION](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/central/current)
  * [BETA_VERSION](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/beta/current)
  * [RELEASE_VERSION](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Template:Version/Gecko/release/current)
  * [Next release date](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:NextReleaseDate). This updates
    * [The next ship date](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:FIREFOX_SHIP_DATE)
    * [The next merge date](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:FIREFOX_MERGE_DATE)
    * [The current cycle](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Template:CURRENT_CYCLE)

### Send merge completion email

Reply to the "please merge m-c => m-b" email. CC `thunderbird-drivers@mozilla.org` and `sheriffs@mozilla.org`.  The content should be like:
```
gecko versions are now as follows:
    m-c = 56
    m-b = 55
beta is still closed. Sheriffs may re-open when CI looks good
central nightly builds have been triggered.
Gecko version in bouncer for nightlies will be updated tomorrow
Entries in the wiki have been also updated.
```

### Bump bouncer versions

1. When we have good nightlies from `mozilla-central` with the new version, update the [bouncer](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com) locations for:
    1. [firefox-nightly-latest](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/location/?product__id__exact=2005)
    1. [firefox-nightly-latest-ssl](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/location/?product__id__exact=6508)
    1. [firefox-nightly-latest-l10n](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/location/?product__id__exact=6506)
    1. [firefox-nightly-latest-l10n-ssl](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/location/?product__id__exact=6507)
    1. [firefox-nightly-stub](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/location/?product__id__exact=6509)
    1. [firefox-nightly-stub-l10n](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/location/?product__id__exact=6512)

NB: it is expected that the two stub products have a win and win64 location which both point to the same location. We don't have a win64 stub installer, instead the mislabeled 32bit stub selects the correct full installer at runtime.

### Trim bouncer's Check Now list

1. Once per release cycle we should stop checking old releases to see if they're present
1. Visit the [list of check now enabled products](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/product/?all=&checknow__exact=1)
1. you should leave all current and upcoming releases enabled, as well as the updates for watershed releases. Typically this is about 100 products
1. Select all the old releases not covered above, and use the 'Remove Check Now on selected products' option in the Action dropdown
